## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
TODO: Add your explanation
During the initial training phase, I realized that the predictions generated by the model were not in the correct format required for submission to the Kaggle competition. To rectify this, I needed to ensure that the output included the predicted counts of bike sharing demand for each observation in the test dataset.

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
TODO: Add your explanation
The top-ranked model that performed during the initial training phase was the Random Forest regressor.
## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
TODO: Add your explanation
The exploratory analysis revealed several interesting insights into the dataset. For example, we discovered strong correlations between certain weather conditions and bike usage patterns. Additionally, we found that the time of day and day of the week had a significant impact on bike demand. To leverage these insights, we created new features such as weather condition indicators and time-related features like hour of the day and day of the week.
### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
TODO: Add your explanation
After adding additional features, our model's performance improved significantly. The inclusion of weather condition indicators and time-related features provided the model with more relevant information to make predictions. This resulted in a better understanding of the underlying patterns in the data and improved the model's ability to capture variations in bike demand across different conditions and time periods.
## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
TODO: Add your explanation
After tuning the hyperparameters, our model's performance improved even further. By optimizing the hyperparameters, we were able to fine-tune the model's behavior and enhance its predictive accuracy. Specifically, adjusting parameters such as the number of trees in the Random Forest and the learning rate in the Gradient Boosting model helped us achieve better results.
### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
TODO: Add your explanation
If given more time with this dataset, I would focus on exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques and experimenting with ensemble methods to further enhance model performance. Additionally, I would explore other machine learning algorithms and conduct more extensive hyperparameter tuning to identify the optimal configuration for each model.

## Summary
TODO: Add your explanation
In summary, our journey to predict bike sharing demand using AutoGluon was marked by iterative experimentation and refinement. We started with initial training, where we encountered challenges in formatting the predictions for submission. Through exploratory data analysis and feature creation, we gained valuable insights into the dataset, which enabled us to improve model performance by adding relevant features. Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced our models' predictive accuracy, leading to better results. Overall, our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of AutoGluon in tackling real-world regression problems.
